# Solar Explorer 🌍🌌

This is my **modified version** of a Solar System simulation project.  
I started with an existing project I found online, and then customized it by:  
- Rewriting the planet descriptions in my own words.  
- Making visual adjustments to the animations and styles.  
- Adding new interactive elements.  

The goal was to learn by **studying existing code** and then making it **my own**.

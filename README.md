# 🌌 Solar Explorer

Solar Explorer is a simple **solar system simulation** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It visually demonstrates how planets orbit around the Sun with smooth animations.  

⚠️ **Note:** This project is for **study and learning purposes only**.  
The base code was adapted from online references, and I made some small changes to understand the concepts better.  
All credits go to the original creator(s).
